In this course, students will learn how to use scientific observation and experimentation to answer questions like these. Students will also learn about life science, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology, and physics. The class will be divided into small groups that will complete projects on a variety of topics in the sciences.\n",
      "In addition to developing their understanding of STEM topics, students will work together with peers from across Massachusetts to solve real-world problems. Teams will brainstorm and develop a prototype solution to a challenge posed by a local partner organization. This year's challenge asks teams to design a solution that improves quality of life for residents in a senior living facility.\n",

      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh. Here's what happens:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight**: When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it contains all the colors of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet).\n",
      "2. **Molecules**: The air molecules in the atmosphere are much smaller than the wavelength of light. These tiny molecules include nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and other gases.\n",
      "3. **Scattering**: When sunlight hits these small air molecules, it scatters in all directions. This scattering is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, because they are more easily deflected by the smaller molecules.\n",
      "4. **Blue dominance**: As a result of this scattering, the shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) are distributed throughout the sky, while the longer wavelengths (like red and orange) continue to travel in straight lines, reaching our eyes with less scattering.\n",
      "5. **Our perception**: Our brains perceive the combined light from all directions as blue, since it's the dominant color after scattering. The blue color is more pronounced during the daytime, when the sun is overhead, and less intense at sunrise and sunset, when the sunlight has to travel longer distances through the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other factors can influence the apparent blue color of the sky, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Dust and pollution**: These particles can absorb or scatter light in different ways, affecting the overall hue.\n",
      "* **Clouds**: Clouds can reflect and scatter light, making the sky appear more white or gray.\n",
      "* **Atmospheric conditions**: The color of the sky can also be affected by temperature, humidity, and other atmospheric factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the blue color of the sky is primarily due to the scattering of sunlight by small air molecules in the atmosphere, with shorter wavelengths (like blue) being distributed throughout the sky."
